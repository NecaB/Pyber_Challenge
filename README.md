Pyber Challenge

Overview of Analysis

This project seeks to perform an exploratory analysis on the ridesharing data of a company; Pyber. To perform this analysis visualizations of ridesharing and fare related metrics were created and then compared within the rural, urban and suburban cities that Pyber operates. The results from this analysis aims to determine if the services are affordable for underserved neighborhoods and access to ride-sharing services should be improved. 

Results 
The fare metrics when compared in all cities that Pyber operates showed that:
-	Urban cities had the highest usage 1,625 rides while rural cities had the least 125, this could be because of population density, in that urban cities are usually more populated than rural cities. 
-	Urban cities had approximately five (5) times more drivers than suburban cities which could also be attributed to the above factor as well. As the demand is greater in urban cities.
-	Suburban cities accounted for six (6) times more drivers and four (4) times more revenue when compared to rural cities. This could be due to the income propensity of suburban users, where they may be able to afford and spend more.
-	Rural cities had the highest average fare for both driver and per ride, this may have resulted in less usage and hence the reason for lesser performing fare metrics in comparison to urban and suburban cities.
It was also noted that there was a correlation between higher fare revenue by city type when the ratio of driver to rides is higher. 

Summary

Based on the analysis performed it may be concluded that: 

	There are more users of the ridesharing services in urban cities. There were also more drivers in urban cities when compared to rural cities which may have created the potential for greater revenue from urban cities.

	The highest cost for using Pyber was in Rural cities, the high average fare per ride in rural cities may have caused a reduction in demand as well as the low demand for drivers. Rural cities may also be more sparsely populated implying a lesser demand and would require longer travel distances, a factor for the above stated results.

	An analysis of the demand for the services would assist in determining how to appropriate resources where needed while considering income, population and mileage correlations to the demand.
